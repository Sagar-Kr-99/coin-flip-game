#Problem Statement<br>

Q. If the number I generate is greater than or equal to 40, you win (so you have a 60% chance of victory) 
   and I pay you some money. If it is below 40, I win and you pay me the same amount.
   
   Now I offer you the the following choices. 
   Which one you will choose ?<br>
   (a) Game 1 — play 100 times, betting $1 each time.<br>
   (b) Game 2— play 10 times, betting $10 each time.<br>
   (c) Game 3— play one time, betting $100.<br>
   
   
   Which would you pick? The expected value of each game is the same.
   
   
   
   Let’s visualize the results with a Monte Carlo simulation (we will run 10,000 simulations of each game type)
